# NLPproject
A rule based NLP system for determining Offensive language using String Similarity &amp; Heuristic Filtering.
Developed a two-stage NLP pipeline to detect offensive language in multilingual input, specifically handling Bengali and English.
– Implemented Unicode-based language identification to classify text as Bengali, English, or others.
– Filtered out non-supported languages to ensure focused offensive detection only on Bengali-English inputs.
– Applied preprocessing, tokenization, and ML techniques to detect abusive or harmful content in the supported languages.
– Focused on code-mixed text, Unicode handling, and low-resource language processing.
– Tools used: Python, Unicode, pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, GitHub datasets.
